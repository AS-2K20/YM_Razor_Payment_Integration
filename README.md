**Step 1:** Go to Razor Payment Website and create an Account (https://razorpay.com/).

**Step 2:** Login to your account and Go to the Dashboard of RazorPay.

**Step 3:** By Default, you will be in Test Mode but make sure you are in it. We would be using __Test Mode__ as of now.

NOTE: There are 2 modes in Razor Payment Gateway:

* __Test Mode:__ This mode is for testing and for developers who are just getting started in Razor Payment Integration. Test Mode is completely Free of Charge. No real charges will be made, even if we give our valid card details in the Razor Payment Gateway Page.

* __Live Mode:__ As the name suggests, In the Live Mode, we would be charged for real. In order to work on Live Mode, we have to give our bank account and KYC Details.
